# AlphaZero-Chess (from scratch)

An educational implementation of a chess AI inspired by AlphaZero.
This repository demonstrates self-play training with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and a Policy-Value neural network (PyTorch).

## Quickstart
\\\ash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/main.py
\\\

## Roadmap
- [ ] Minimal MCTS without NN
- [ ] Policy-Value network (PyTorch)
- [ ] Self-play training loop
- [ ] Evaluation (new vs old network)
- [ ] Simple UI (play vs AI)
